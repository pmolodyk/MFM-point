We introduce a scalable and efficient multi-scale Flow Matching framework for point cloud generation, referred to as MFM-point, which adopts a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm. Compared with existing flow-based methods for point cloud generation, our multi-scale approach facilitates more effective modeling for complex point cloud generation tasks, such as multi-category or high-resolution settings. A key challenge in developing such a multi-scale framework for point cloud generation lies in preserving the inherent geometric structure of point clouds, which lack a regular topology, while also ensuring consistent and rigorous distributional transitions between coarse and fine resolutions. To address this challenge, we propose a structured downsampling strategy based on equal-size K-means clustering, paired with a principled upsampling algorithm that maintains alignment between coarse and fine representations. This multi-scale design reduces the reliance on expensive matching solvers, enhancing the training efficiency. Our experimental results demonstrate that MFM-Point achieves state-of-the-art performance among flow matching and diffusion-based models, with particularly strong results in multi-category and high-resolution scenarios.
